          The first Russian nested doll set was carved in 1890 at the Children's
          Education Workshop by Vasily Zvyozdochkin and designed by Sergey
          Malyutin, who was a folk crafts painter in the Abramtsevo estate of
          Savva Mamontov, a Russian industrialist and patron of arts. Mamontov's
          brother, Anatoly Ivanovich Mamontov (1839–1905) created the Children's
          Education Workshop to make and sell children's toys. The doll set was
          painted by Malyutin. Malyutin's doll set consisted of eight dolls—the
          outermost was a mother in a traditional dress holding a red-combed
          rooster. The inner dolls were her children, girls and a boy, and the
          innermost a baby. The Children's Education Workshop was closed in the
          late 1890s, but the tradition of the matryoshka simply relocated to
          Sergiyev Posad, the Russian city known as a toy-making center since
          the fourteenth century.
          <br />
          The inspiration for matryoshka dolls is not clear. It is believed that
          Zvyozdochkin and Malyutin were inspired by eastern Asian culture, for
          example, the Honshu doll, named after the main island of Japan,
          however, the Honshu figures cannot be placed one inside another.
          Sources differ in descriptions of the doll, describing it as either a
          round, hollow daruma doll, portraying a bald old Buddhist monk, or a
          Seven Lucky Gods nesting doll.
          <br />
          Savva Mamontov's wife presented the dolls at the Exposition
          Universelle in Paris in 1900, where the toy earned a bronze medal.
          Soon after, matryoshka dolls were being made in several places in
          Russia and shipped around the world.

          Ordinarily, matryoshka dolls are crafted from linden wood. There is a
          popular misconception that they are carved from one piece of wood.
          Rather, they are produced using: a lathe equipped with a balance bar;
          four heavy 2 foot (0.61 m) long distinct types of chisels (hook,
          knife, pipe, and spoon); and a "set of handmade wooden calipers
          particular to a size of the doll". The tools are hand forged by a
          village blacksmith from car axles or other salvage. A wood carver
          uniquely crafts each set of wooden calipers. Multiple pieces of wood
          are meticulously carved into the nesting set.
